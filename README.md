# EasyFileReader.js

## Introduction
- This Library facilitates the implementation of JavaScript file reading capabilities into your HTML's Event Listeners. 
-- This Library supports reading multiple files at once and returns the file metadata as well as the file contents. 
-- Finally, it includes an optional script to assist with the creation of the relevant Event Listeners.

- The Library includes a primary script (EasyFileReader.js) and an optional secondary script (EasyListener.js). 
-- Each of those scripts have their own .md file which explains their purpose, functionality, and implementation in greater detail.
-- Additionally, there is an example index.html file which demonstrates the use of these scripts (and an accomponying stylesheet.css file for stylization).
